### No matter where you are, the skills and requirements for a penetration tester will be the same. Youâ€™ll be required to have a good understanding of various aspects within information security including web applications, networks and sometimes even low level technology like assembly. A good understanding of these technologies is essential to learning how to exploit them.

### The aim of this path is to make you ready for real world penetration testing by teaching you how to use industry standard tools along with a methodology to find vulnerabilities in machines. By the time you complete this path, you will be well prepared for interviews and jobs as a penetration tester. To complete this path you should have a basic to medium understanding of computing.
